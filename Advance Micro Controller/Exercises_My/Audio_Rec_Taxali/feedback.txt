 TASK RELATED FEEDBACK
 1)The project is not fully complete, meaning some debugging is required which is beyond my scope and some expert advice is needed.
 2)As far as the concept goes for the audio recorder I am pretty sure that I am right on that point and some 
 code fixes are required to make it run perfectly. 
 3)The live streaming from a PC to the Mic input via aux cable works but its distorted(I havent tried it with a microphone though as I dont have one). The record function does record some distorted audio samples
 but not complete and the reason is something im not completley sure .  
 4)There are some times I have observed that while debugging is that during the spi_read or spi_write my code goes into the lowpower mode and does,nt come out but it is not always the case 
 also in the last feedback I was told to do active waiting which I do in my isr but do I have to do it before as well?? I dont understand why?
 
 GENERAL FEEDBACK
 1)The Exercise was interesting but it is alot of work although it gave me an imense amount of knowledge but 
 should be of more credits.
 2)It would have been easier to implement it in a group as it helps analyse shortcoming better and also saves a lot of time without compromising the knowledge
 3) All in all I need to get some expertise while debugging a code, it sounds wiered but I still dont know a lot of reasons to some issues and in this case as well.
