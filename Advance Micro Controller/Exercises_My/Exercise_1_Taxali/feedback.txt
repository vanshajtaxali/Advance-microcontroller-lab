 GENERAL FEEDBACK
 1)The Exercise was interesting but it is time consuming and soaks a lot of energy but yes helpful in learning
 2)If possible allow group submissions as each exercise is a mini project itself and can save a lot of time without hindering the 
 learning process
 
 TASK RELATED FEEDBACK
 1)Could not implement the bonus question I guess I could not completley understandd the character implementation but, I did do some Hit and trial
 but they were partially successfull.
 2)LCD always show gibberish output in the first run despite lcd_clear() dont know why? I guess some problem with my lcd_init() function
 3)Implemented the main function haphhazardly tried implementing all functions.
 4)Some external help was taken to optimise library function.
