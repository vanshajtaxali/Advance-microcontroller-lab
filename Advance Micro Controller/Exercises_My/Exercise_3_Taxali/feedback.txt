GENERAL FEEDBACK
 This exercise was seriously very hard. 
 The amount of reading it required was way to much although it was fun but it was very time consuming
 as I have not implemented the I2C library in EX2 I did it here (ofcourse application specific) hence it was double effort.
 One suggestion : Kindly give little more time for execution and when we have to build everything from scratch it becomes
 very difficult to have a perfect implrmrntation
 
 TASK RELATED FEEDBACK
 I could not understand the use of implementing adac.h as it is not required hence I did not do it
 I could not implement bubble implementation as it was very difficult for me to callibrate it with the sensor and also havent 
 implemented charachter implementation previously instead I print values of each individual axis
 And appologies for late submission as my cable broke down.
