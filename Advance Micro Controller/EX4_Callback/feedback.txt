 GENERAL FEEDBACK
 This exercise was easier than the last one in terms of studying but logical implementation was not that easy. 
 It was fun but it was very time consuming
 I could not complete the main function as required on time as there are some bug fixes required for my libraries.
	
 TASK RELATED FEEDBACK
1)I am not completley sure if my interrupt_routine was implemented correctly it was really ahead scratcher!
2)A lot of debugging has been done and tried my level best to do as much as possible.
3)the problem is my program does not go in the  
if(spi_txdataLength > 0) condition when i implement flash_write(); withe spi_write(); it goes i guess the issue is with the interrupt flags 
4)I would like to discuss this with you in person whenever possible and correct my mistakes.
The extra time I debugged it and made it a little better and was enlightenment indeed but thats not enough as the upcoming
project need much more indepth knowledge.
