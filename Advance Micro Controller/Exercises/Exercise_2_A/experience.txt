The presence of the init functions is confusing, and introduces a lot of hassle because I'm trying to keep it useful to some extent, while it is unnecessary in our case, since we always need a start condition with the address of the I2C device to do either begin writing or reading. 
Since I'm trying to keep my design as modular as possible, I'm only calling it my init functions at the beginning, even though I'm not actually using them.
